You are a senior frontend/UI engineer working inside my multi‑app Django SaaS project that uses plain HTML/CSS/JS templates (no CDN, all assets local). Your job now is to globally unify and upgrade the frontend design across the entire project: all dashboards, layouts, navigation, and components.

I have some strong design preferences I want you to respect across the entire project. The overall look should use a light background with high text contrast and subtle alternating section backgrounds (for example pure white and a slightly tinted variant) so pages stay readable and visually engaging. The style must feel clean, professional, and production‑ready, not like a generic AI‑generated UI. I also want a fully unified SVG icon language: same stroke weight, sizes, and color logic everywhere, with appropriate icons for every important action or section. Spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy should be carefully tuned so all pages feel balanced and easy to scan. Finally, I want a glassmorphism aesthetic applied consistently across the whole site: translucent surfaces, soft background blur, and subtle depth effects should be integrated into cards, panels, and key UI elements in a coherent, system‑wide way.
​
Goals:  
- Create a single, cohesive design system that is applied consistently across every page, app, and dashboard.  
- Modernize the visual style so it feels clean, professional, and production‑ready, without looking like generic AI UI.  
- Use a light background with strong text contrast and subtle alternating section backgrounds (e.g. white and a slightly tinted variant) to keep pages readable and engaging.  
- Replace all inconsistent or missing icons with a unified icon set and style (SVG icons, same stroke/size rules), and make sure every important action/section has an appropriate icon.  
- Improve spacing, alignment, and hierarchy so all pages feel balanced and easy to scan.

Project constraints and context:  
- Tech stack: Django templates + static HTML/CSS/JS, no React.  
- All CSS, JS, fonts, and icons must remain local (no external CDNs).  
- There are multiple dashboards and many reused components (cards, tables, sidebars, navbars, forms, stats boxes, dropdowns, modals, alerts).  
- The same component types must look and behave the same everywhere: one unified style for buttons, cards, tables, tabs, badges, alerts, etc.  
- Keep everything responsive and accessible (good contrast, focus states, keyboard navigation where relevant).

Your tasks:  
1. Scan the entire project (templates and static files) and identify all existing layouts, dashboards, and reusable components. Build a short design_system_audit.md that lists:  
   - All component types you find (buttons, tables, cards, sidebars, navbars, forms, alerts, badges, etc.).  
   - Current problems: inconsistent colors, fonts, shadows, radiuses, icons, spacing, duplicated styles, inline CSS, etc.  
2. Define a small, unified design system and implement it in central CSS files:  
   - Introduce CSS variables for colors, spacing, radiuses, and shadows.  
   - Choose a distinctive but professional typography pairing (headings + body) and wire it globally.  
   - Define canonical styles for core components (buttons, cards, tables, badges, alerts, input fields, navbars, sidebars, dashboard cards, etc.).  
   - Ensure hover, active, and focus states are clear and consistent.  
3. Unify icons and visual language:  
   - Pick one consistent icon style (e.g. outline SVG icons) and apply it across all dashboards and components.  
   - Replace any mismatched or low‑quality icons with clean, consistent SVGs.  
   - Ensure icon sizes, colors, and alignment are uniform across the app.  
4. Apply the new design system everywhere:  
   - Refactor templates to use the unified components instead of ad‑hoc styles.  
   - Remove or simplify duplicated CSS and inline styles, migrating them into the shared CSS files.  
   - Make sure all dashboards share the same visual language: same spacing scale, same card style, same sidebar/navbar style, same typography rules.  
5. Add subtle but production‑grade motion:  
   - Light transitions on hovers, dropdowns, and modals (no flashy animations, just smooth micro‑interactions).  
   - Respect reduced‑motion preferences where possible.  
6. Keep everything production‑ready:  
   - Do not break existing URLs, view logic, or Django template tags.  
   - Keep the HTML structure compatible with Django template inheritance and blocks.  
   - Avoid unnecessary libraries; prefer clean, maintainable CSS and small JS enhancements.

Working style:  
- Work iteratively. For each group of changes, show the unified CSS and a couple of key templates before and after so the transformation is clear.  
- When you introduce new components (e.g. a canonical “dashboard stat card” or “primary button”), make them reusable and replace old variants across the codebase.  
- If you need to make assumptions (e.g. picking an icon set or exact color palette), choose sensible defaults that fit a professional SaaS dashboard and keep them consistent across the whole project.

Do not stop after a few pages. Apply this unified design system to **all** dashboards, layouts, and components in the project so the entire site feels like one coherent product.
