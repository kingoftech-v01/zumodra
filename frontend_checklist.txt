✅ Zumodra Frontend Redesign Checklist
1. Typography Overhaul
 Replace system fonts with a distinctive, brand‑appropriate combination (e.g., DM Serif Display + General Sans, Fraunces + Satoshi, or Clash Display + Switzer).

 Implement typography setup in staticfiles/assets/scss/base/font.scss.

 Define clear heading and body font hierarchy (H1–H6, paragraph, small text).

 Adjust line heights, tracking, and spacing for better readability and elegance.

 Ensure font loading is optimized (self‑hosted or local files, no external CDN).

2. Color System Refinement
 Move away from Tailwind’s default blue (#2563eb).

 Define a new color palette in tailwind.config.js and staticfiles/css/dark-mode.css.

 Propose and apply one of the following palette directions or variations:

Warm coral + deep navy (approachable yet professional)

Rich emerald + gold accents (trust and growth)

Deep violet + warm cream (modern sophistication)

 Apply consistent color logic for light/dark modes and accessibility compliance.

3. Atmospheric Depth
 Replace flat solid backgrounds (bg-white, bg-gray-50) with richer ones.

 Introduce subtle gradient meshes for hero sections or dashboards.

 Add noise/grain textures for tactile visual depth.

 Use geometric patterns or decorative shapes in header/footer areas.

 Experiment with layered transparencies (blurred/glassy layers).

 Maintain performance and subtlety — no visual clutter.

4. Spatial Composition
 Break the standard sidebar‑header‑content layout in key templates.

 Add asymmetrical layouts or elements overlapping the grid.

 Introduce diagonal or non‑linear visual flow.

 Use generous negative space deliberately for contrast.

 Apply responsive layout variations that feel dynamic yet consistent.

5. Motion and Micro‑Interactions
 Create a cohesive motion design language across the frontend.

 Add staggered page‑load animations (elements appearing with rhythm).

 Implement scroll‑triggered transitions for section reveals.

 Use orchestrated animation sequences (not random or isolated).

 Refine hover/focus states with delightful, on‑brand microinteractions.

 Centralize animation logic in staticfiles/js/micro-interactions.js.

6. Component Personality
 Redesign cards with depth, shadow layering, and hover animations.

 Redesign buttons with unique colors, shapes (rounded corners, ghost styles), and motion feedback.

 Redesign tables for modern data visualization — soft borders, hover rows, interactive sorting.

 Redesign stat blocks / KPI components with icons, motion, or gradients.

 Apply consistent aesthetic identity across all components.

7. Brand Cohesion and Memorability
 Establish a clear, recognizable visual identity (font + color + motion + component shape language).

 Add at least one signature design element — something instantly recognizable as “Zumodra.”

 Maintain accessibility, performance, and responsiveness throughout.

 Ensure the entire system remains frontend‑only and production‑ready.
